Takeaway - MA Week 3 challenge 
=====
Briefing

Design a takeaway app

Expectations:
-------------------

    list of dishes with prices
    placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total.
    If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying
    that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your
    order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
    The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
    Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API
    Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
    Make sure that your Takeaway class is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to
    not to send texts when your tests are run
    However, if your Takeaway class is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
